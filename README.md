# üö™ Touchless Entry-Exit Data Tracking System (TEED-TS)

## üìñ Overview
The **Touchless Entry-Exit Data Tracking System (TEED-TS)** is a hygienic, non-contact solution designed to monitor entry and exit movements. It uses **Infrared (IR) sensors**, the **ESP8266 microcontroller**, and **IoT technologies** to provide real-time data tracking while reducing physical contact.

Collected data is visualized through dynamic graphs and stored in CSV format, making it suitable for environments requiring reliable monitoring, such as:
- üè• Hospitals  
- üè¢ Offices  
- üõí Retail Spaces  
- üõ°Ô∏è Security Zones

## ‚ú® Features
- **Touchless Monitoring**: Tracks entry/exit movements using IR sensors.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays real-time entry/exit counts via animated bar graphs.
- **Data Logging**: Saves timestamped data in CSV format for analysis.
- **Hygienic and Efficient**: Reduces human contact and contamination risk.
- **Scalable**: Can integrate with larger networks or more complex setups.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

### üî© Hardware
| Component      | Quantity | Description                              |
|----------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| **IR Sensors** | 4        | Detect interruptions in infrared beams.  |
| **ESP8266**    | 1        | Microcontroller for data processing.     |
| **Breadboard** | 1        | For prototyping the circuit.             |
| **Jumper Wires** | Set     | Connect components to the circuit.       |

### üíª Software
1. **Arduino IDE**: For programming the ESP8266 microcontroller.
2. **Python**: For data processing and visualization.
   - Libraries used:
     - `pymongo`: Handles data logging using MongoDB.
     - `time` & `datetime`: For timestamps.
     - `flask/socket_io`: For creating animated bar graphs in a web page with the log datas being displayed!.
     - `env`: For storing creditials of MongoDB.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Initialization**:  
   - The ESP8266 connects to Wi-Fi to sync the current time from an NTP server.

2. **Detection**:  
   - IR sensors monitor movements by detecting interruptions in their beams.

3. **Data Processing**:  
   - The ESP8266 categorizes events as **entry** or **exit** and sends the data to the MongoDB server.
   - Timestamped data is logged in MongoDB Database.

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Real-time bar graphs show ongoing entry/exit counts.
   - Interval-based graphs provide insights every 5 minutes.

## üìä Results

| **Metric**               | **Performance**                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**              | ~95% in controlled environments. |
| **Sensor Response Time**  | 0.5 seconds (average).           |
| **Uptime**                | 100% (during testing).           |
| **Test Period Data**      | 98 entries, 96 exits (24 hours). |
